Our project consists of a neural network learning algorithm that utilizes back-propagation to effectively learn to identify emotions ovee the course of multiple training epochs. Our dataset consists of photos taken of 20 different people, all making different expressions and conveying different emotions. An added wrinkle is that some of the photos include people wth sunglasses, and some don't. We wanted to find out if the presence of sunglasses makes it harder for a network to identify emotion, and this model was created to do just that.
