Task 3: Neural network learning to recognize faces. A neural network learning algorithm called Back-propagation is among the most effective approaches to machine learning when the data includes complex sensory input such as images. The data set contains face images from 20 different persons with different emotions and poses. Write your codes to implement the neural network, by which you are expected to classify the emotions. That is, you are expected to classify the images into four classes: neutral, happy, sad, angry. Then compare the results between the following two cases: (1) include the face images with sunglasses in training and (2) not include face images with sunglasses in training, and analyze your results.

Our project consists of a neural network learning algorithm that utilizes back-propagation to effectively learn to identify emotions ovee the course of multiple training epochs. Our dataset consists of photos taken of 20 different people, all making different expressions and conveying different emotions. An added wrinkle is that some of the photos include people wth sunglasses, and some don't. We wanted to find out if the presence of sunglasses makes it harder for a network to identify emotion, and this model was created to do just that.
